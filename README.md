## Introduction
Atop is an ASCII full-screen performance monitor for Linux that is capable
of reporting the activity of all processes (even if processes have finished
during the interval), daily logging of system and process activity for
long-term analysis, highlighting overloaded system resources by using colors,
etcetera. At regular intervals, it shows system-level activity related to the
CPU, memory, swap, disks (including LVM) and network layers, and for every
process (and thread) it shows e.g. the CPU utilization, memory growth,
disk utilization, priority, username, state, and exit code.
In combination with the optional kernel module *netatop*,
it even shows network activity per process/thread.
